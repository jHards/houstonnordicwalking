We hold group sessions every Saturday with an always entertaining, diverse set of walkers - private sessions are available throughout the week. Classes are extremely flexible and can be modified to suit individual needs. We ensure you get a great challenging work out; cardio combined with strength training to suit the level of the group.

Our aim is to spread the word around Houston about just how effective and fun this full-body, outdoor workout is. People living in Houston are always keen to try new things, keep Ô¨Åt and get out and about in this fantastic city! We also are proud that Nordic walking is a 'green' activity.

All classes are lead by a licensed fitness instructor.
